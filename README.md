# logrifle
A console-based logviewer written in java that is designed to help "rifle through" large logfiles.

## Building
logrifle is built using maven. A runnable jar archive can be created with

```mvn -B package --file pom.xml```

## Usage
Run 

```java -jar logrifle.jar --help```

to display information on the invocation in in-application commands / shortcuts.

## Supported Platforms
I only tested logrifle on Linux. I would assume it also runs fine on Windows and MacOS but I am not testing it on either of these.
